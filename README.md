# PYT-Tasks
This Repository is especially created for PickYourTrail Tasks. This has three java source files,

 1. UniqueArray.java
 2. SuperStack.java
 3. CountingPairs.java

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you how to run the java files in an easier way in your local machines. In the top right corner of the project you will find clone or download button. Click and download the project as zip file to your local machine and extract it a specific folder.

# ---- COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE ----

If you know how to compile programs on the command line, and if you have downloaded the files, you can easily compile and run all the examples.
Open a command prompt to that specific folder location to which you have extracted the files by using the below command

 cd \Files_location\
 
 To check whether JAVA is installed in your computer, execute below command 
 
  java -version

 To Compile the files

      javac *.java
