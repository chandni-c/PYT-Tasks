# PYT-Tasks
This Repository is especially created for PickYourTrail Tasks. This has three java source files,

 1. UniqueArray.java
 2. SuperStack.java
 3. CountingPairs.java

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you how to run the java files in an easier way in your local machines. 

# ---- COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE ----

If you know how to compile programs on the command line, and if you have downloaded the examples, you can easily compile and run all the examples.

      javac *.java
                  
This is to compile all the examples from that chapter.  As long as your compiler supports Java 7 or higher, there should be no errors.
